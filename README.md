# Harmony Naomi Niyongabo – Resume Website

Welcome to my personal resume website. I created this project to present my professional background, leadership journey, academic experience, and achievements in a clear, organized, and responsive format. This site serves as a digital extension of my resume and allows recruiters, collaborators, or anyone interested to learn more about who I am and what I’ve done.

##  Features

### 1. Section-Based Layout

My website is divided into structured, semantic sections to make it easy to navigate and read. These include:

- **About Me** – A brief overview of who I am and my passions.
- **Work Experience** – Details about my professional roles and responsibilities.
- **Education** – My academic background and notable achievements.
- **Leadership & Activities** – Projects and programs where I’ve taken initiative and contributed meaningfully.
- **Awards & Recognition** – Honors and distinctions I've earned over the years.
- **Contact** – How to reach me via email or WhatsApp.

### 2. Smooth Scrolling Navigation

Each navigation link at the top scrolls smoothly to its corresponding section. This is handled using vanilla JavaScript (`scrollIntoView`) to enhance user experience by avoiding abrupt jumps across the page.

---

### 3. Responsive Design

The layout is fully responsive:

- On desktops, sections are arranged side-by-side with clear spacing.
- On mobile devices, sections stack vertically for easy readability.
- Media queries are used in the CSS to ensure consistent layout behavior across devices.

### 4. PDF Resume Download

The “Download CV” button in the top navigation opens my resume in PDF format in a new browser tab. From there, the visitor can either view or download it directly. This ensures the resume is always accessible in a portable, printable format.

---

### 5. Direct Contact Integration

In the Contact section:

- **Email Link** – Opens Gmail’s compose window in a new tab with my email (`hniyongabo@alustudent.com`) already filled in.
- **WhatsApp Link** – Opens a direct chat with me on WhatsApp using `https://wa.me/250796176320`.

These links allow anyone to quickly get in touch with me using the platforms they prefer.

##  Technologies Used

This site was built with:

- **HTML5** – Semantic and accessible markup structure.
- **CSS3** – Custom variables, responsive grid layout, and modern styling techniques.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Lightweight interactivity without any external libraries.

No frameworks or templates were used — every line of code is handwritten and tailored to my content and goals.
